# Air-Quality-Analysis-Monitoring-Dashboard-India-

**Description**
An interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes air quality data across cities to monitor pollution levels, identify trends, and support data-driven environmental and public health decisions.

**Tech Stack**
Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, visualization, dashboard creation
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures and KPIs
Microsoft Excel / CSV – Intermediate data handling (if applicable)
Data Source: Data imported from Inttruv.

**Data Source**
The dataset is sourced from Inttruv, providing structured air quality and environmental data for analysis.

**Features & Highlights of the Project**
Business Problem
Urban areas face increasing air pollution, but stakeholders lack a centralized system to monitor pollution trends, identify high-risk locations, and take timely action.

**Goal of the Dashboard**
Track Air Quality Index (AQI) across cities and time periods
Identify pollution hotspots
Monitor trends for major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃)
Support decision-making for environmental planning and public awareness

**Key Visuals – Walkthrough**

KPI Cards: Overall AQI, average pollution level, number of critical days
City-wise Map Visualization: Geographic distribution of AQI levels
Trend Line Charts: Monthly/weekly AQI trends over time
Bar Charts: Comparison of pollutant levels by city
AQI Category Distribution: Good, Moderate, Poor, Severe days
Slicers: City, Date range, Pollutant type for interactive filtering

**Business Impact & Insights**
Helps authorities identify high-pollution cities and peak pollution periods
Supports preventive action planning and environmental policy decisions
Enables organizations to monitor environmental risk for operations
Raises public awareness about air quality conditions
Provides a data-driven foundation for sustainability initiatives
